# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data
This project uses a logistic regression model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The implementation covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new input data.

# Features
Binary Classification: Predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data.
Data Preprocessing: Handles the loading and preprocessing of the sonar dataset.
Model Training and Evaluation: Uses logistic regression to train the model and evaluates its performance.
Prediction on New Data: Provides functionality to make predictions on new input data.
# Technology Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
